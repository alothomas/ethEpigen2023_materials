1- Paper chosen: Histone Methyltransferase SETDB1 Regulates
the Development of Cortical Htr3a-Positive
Interneurons and Mood Behaviors (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2022.08.021)


2- ATAC-seq of experiment ?? mice embryonic cell with Setdb1-NS-cKOs (but where to find it)


3- The goal is to show that SETDB1 represses Htr3a transcription via RMER21B-mediated distal chromatin interaction in the embryonic ganglionic eminence of mice.
